      <h3>Some other things about me</h3>
      <p>You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. We'll put a happy little sky in here. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.</p>
      <p id="lead-paragraph">Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. We'll have a super time. Let that brush dance around there and play. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch.</p>
      <p>The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. A fan brush can be your best friend. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Use your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagination/">imagination</a>, let it go.</p>
      <p>We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Son of a gun. We'll put a happy little sky in here. Take your time. Speed will come later. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Only eight colors that you need. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you.</p>
      <p class="important">I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. We'll make some happy little bushes here. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends.</p>
      <p>We can fix anything. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. You can spend all day playing with mountains. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. A beautiful little sunset.</p>
      <p class="small-caps">Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. See there, told you that would be easy. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted.</p>
      <p>Get tough with it, get strong. Don't be bashful drop me a line. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it.</p>
